No AI system can produce satisfactory results without good data. In Novit.AI we go by the maxim [seek truth from facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seek_truth_from_facts), or as some put it: [garbage in, garbage out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)

By deploying custom-tailored sensors anywhere you can have AI producing results on real, objective and natural data rather than estimates and assumptions on excel sheets. We are happy to assist you end-to-end based on your requirements with cloud, edge or hybrid deployments. By using a combination of state-of-the-art hardware from our partners Nvidia and Sony and modern cubesat communications we provide actionable AI and insights anywhere on the planet, directly to your systems.
