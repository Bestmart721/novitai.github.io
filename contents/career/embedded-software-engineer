## A little about us

Novit.AI is a start-up developing novel machine learning solutions to bring automation to scale. We combine information from radar and multispectral satellites with our globally deployable Edge AI devices to trigger unmanned land, sea or air vehicle actions for real world impact.

We are an engineering-first company focused on solving real problems in the world with state-of-the-art tools. We love automation and make heavy use of it in our own workflows. We place a paramount importance on learning and development and help our colleagues be their best selves through collaboration and tutorial sessions.

## A little about the role

For AI to have real world impact, it needs to be out observing the real world and impacting outcomes. As a Novit Embedded Software engineer your task will be making sure the intelligent devices can survive outside and bring intelligence out of cloud data centres to deployable hardware.

This role is designed to grow with you in scope and responsibilities. To be successful in this role you will need to be a multidimensional engineer, open to learning new tools and getting acquainted with other parts of our pipeline from model training to Human-Machine Teaming deployments. This is not a traditional embedded role, but a deep knowledge of embedded systems is critical for quick ramp-on.

This role involves on-site attendance (ODTU Teknokent, Ankara)

## Basic Qualifications:

* BSc or MSc degree in Computer Science/Engineering or Electrical Engineering
