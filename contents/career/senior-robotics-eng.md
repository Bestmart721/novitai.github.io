## A little about us:

Novit.AI is a start-up developing novel machine learning solutions to bring automation to scale. We combine information from radar and multispectral satellites with our globally deployable Edge AI devices to trigger unmanned land, sea or air vehicle actions for real world impact.

We are an engineering-first company focused on solving real problems in the world with state-of-the-art tools. We love automation and make heavy use of it in our own workflows. We place a paramount importance on learning and development and help our colleagues be their best selves through collaboration and tutorial sessions.

## A little about the role:

For AI to have real world impact, it needs to be integrated into tools understandable and usable by humans for easy interaction and communication. As the Senior Robotics Engineer, your main focus will be combining the use of our AI solutions and built-in-house frameworks with your robotics knowledge to develop prototypes and novel technologies.

This role is non-standard in scope and responsibilities. To be successful in this role, you'll need to be ready to lead a multidimensional team in various areas of expertise and be open to learning new tools like ATAK, our primary integration goal. You are expected to be passionate about bringing new project ideas to the team while being a part of UXV implementations of our software solutions and Edge AI products.

This role is hybrid on-site attendance (ODTU Teknokent, Ankara).
